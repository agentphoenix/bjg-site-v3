		<h1>Youth Golf at Brian Jacobs Golf</h1>

		<p>At BJG, in our experience, children will learn and progress to their full potential if placed in a team setting that offers the opportunity to compete and learn in a fun, nurturing environment. We also believe that competition administered correctly is healthy for a child and learning how to compete will serve them well not only in golf but in life. Youth at BJG are only taught within this program and many have evolved into champions at not only junior golf or college golf but also in the classroom and in their respective communities.</p>

		<p>We also want parent involvement as parents are a major part of the equation of success!</p>

		<p>This program is open to children ages 7-17 of any skill level and student must contact us to register.</p>

		<h2>$275 <small>per month per child*</small></h2>

		<p class="text-sm text-muted"><em>*Requires a 10 month commitment</em></p>
