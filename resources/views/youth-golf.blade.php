			<h1>Youth Golf</h1>

			<p>At Brian Jacobs Golf, our experience has taught us that children learn best in social settings with like-minded participants. We believe that competition, administered correctly, is healthy for a child and learning how to compete will serve them well not only in golf, but in life. We exclusively teach within this philosophy and many of our students have evolved into champions at not only the junior golf and collegiate levels, but also in the classroom and their communities.</p>

			<p>During each semester of the Youth Program we cover the rules, etiquette, and history of golf as well as nutrition, fitness, sport psychology, how to compete, and much more.</p>
