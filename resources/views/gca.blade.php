			<h2>FAQs</h2>

			<dl>
				<dt>How is Golf Channel Academy different from other golf instruction options?</dt>
				<dd>The underlying philosophy of Golf Channel Academy - which all of our coaches reinforce - is that good coaching takes place over a period of time, not just one lesson. The relationship between coach and student is more than just "one and done." This is how "teaching" becomes "coaching," which we describe as an on-going relationship devoted to long-lasting improvement. Everything about Golf Channel Academy is devoted to enhancing the "coaching" experience for both teacher and student.</dd>

				<dt>What's the relationship between this Golf Channel Academy and the Golf Channel Academy I see on TV?</dt>
				<dd>Golf Channel Academy is the hands-on coaching extension of the cable network's instruction programming, which includes such shows as The Golf Fix, Lesson Tee Live, and School of Golf. Golf Channel Academy allows you to receive personalized instruction from the very best coaches in the game, including many of the teachers who you see on TV. And you should see many more Golf Channel Academy coaches making appearances on Golf Channel instructional programs in the future.</dd>

				<dt>How are the coaches chosen to be part of Golf Channel Academy?</dt>
				<dd>Golf Channel Academy's primary mission is to bring together the best coaches throughout North America under one network. These coaches have a proven track record of creating significant and sustained improvement in their students. They demonstrate a clear passion for their craft and learning, and are continually striving to enhance their teaching skills so that they can produce even better results for their students.</dd>
				<dd>Golf Channel Academy's executive team–as well as experts from the golf world and academia– has put years of extensive research into identifying these qualities and assembling its initial group of coaches. A number of these coaches were selected with the help of Proponent Group, a golf instructor membership-based organization that features hundreds of the game's top coaches (a large percentage of which form the nucleus of Golf Channel Academy). Golf Channel Academy will continue to study the instruction landscape and add coaches in the future to provide golfers everywhere a chance to learn from the very best.</dd>
